# smnnFRAP
Stochastic modeling and neural network parameter inference for FRAP data analysis

smnnFRAP permits inference of kinetic parameters from FRAP data (diffusion coefficient, bound fraction and residence time). It contains two main modules: 
- **Stochastic model module**: simulate a stochastic hybrid model of FRAP experiments to acquire in silico FRAP curves
- **Parameter inference**: using a library of simulated FRAP curves, perform parameter inference on FRAP data

smnnFRAP was developed as a collaboration between the *Cell Cycle Lab of the University of Patras*, the *IBIS* team at *INRIA-Grenoble – Rhône-Alpes* and the *Automatic Control Lab* at *ETH Zurich*. It is freely distributed, available under the General Public License version 3 (GPL v3).
